# A1 - Production Tools Research

**(No Team):**

- (103031155) Danny Cao

**Class Time:** Thursday 8:30AM  
**Tutor Name:** Jack    

**Note:** I enrolled late into the subject so I was told to do this assignment as a solo, and allowed to submit this after Week 2.

## Section 1: Team Context and Info

>Repeat the following questions for each team member.

**Danny Cao:**

- **Q:** What sorts of production, management, and/or game development tools have you used before?  

> **A:** GitHub, Gitlab, Blender, Maya, Unity Engine, Visual Studio Community, Visual Studio Code

- **Q:** What degree are you studying, and what sorts of jobs/career direction are you considering?  

> **A:** Bachelor of Games Interactivity/Computer Science. Web Developer, Software Engineer, Game Developer, 3D Artist

- **Q:** Have you had previous experience or skill in the area you're aiming towards?

> **A:** Self taught coding prior to tertiary studies, multiple personal projects done.

## Section 2: Knowledge Base Tools

((Max 300 words, not including links))

>List five tools that could be suitable as "knowledge bases": game design documents (GDDs), and technical documents ("tech bibles"), and justify how they can be used as knowledge bases for game projects. Things like Google Drive and OneDrive, Word, and other similar tools can count but try to be creative if you can!).
>
>Some examples for context: Zettlr, Obsidian, Notion, Miro.
>
>Compare the tools and relate it to any/all of your team members and/or their experience, interest, or suitability of the tool.
>
>Some aspects to compare would be resource usage, usability/accessibility, cost and pricing/licensing, etc.
>
> Provide links and screenshots.

### [GitHub](https://github.com)

- Repository hosting website that shipped with many tools and features and built in wiki functionality to support documentation, GDDs and technical documents, a good option to consolidate version control, repository hosting and knowledge base.

*GitHub [pricing model](https://github.com/pricing)*

### [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

- Another wiki/documentation software that is widely used in traditional companies (software development) and game development.
- Comes with many features and has seamless integration with other products in the [Atlassian Suite](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/atlassian-suite-savio-david/), making it perfectly suitable as a knowledge base tool and gives it an edge over its competitors.

*Confluence[ pricing model](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/pricing)*

### [HacknPlan](https://hacknplan.com/)

- Describes themselves as a production/project management software for game developers
- Like previously mentioned software, provides similar features, however the key advantage over tools like GitHub and Confluence is HackNPlan is tailored made and optimised for game developers.

*HacknPlan [pricing](https://hacknplan.com/pricing/)*

### [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/)

- An all in one package that is able to fulfill its role as a knowledge base tool in addition to project management and other stuff.
- An alternative to Confluence and the [Atlassian Suite](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/atlassian-suite-savio-david/) by extension, offering same features.
- Emphasis on being a tool for all sorts of teams not just software development or game development.

*ClickUp [pricing](https://clickup.com/pricing)*

### [Codecks](https://www.codecks.io/)

- Like HackNPlan it is a software tailored towards game developers.
- Key standout feature is the integration with feedback collection from the community.
- Side note: I've actually just started using this recently, big fan so far its like Trello but better....

## Section 3: Team Experience Map

((No word limit in this section))

>List any software/tools you have experience in, in the order of your 'main tool' to the one least used.

#### Danny Cao:

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Git & GitHub
3. Blender
4. Maya
5. 4. Visual Studio
6. Unity Engine

## Section 4: Asset Creation Tool Comparison

((Max 300 words, not including links))

>Pick three asset creation tools (i.e. non game engine tools), and similar to previous sections, compare and comment on experience, interest and suitability of the tool. Also compare licensing and pricing differences between competing tools. Provide links/sources.

### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

- Free and open source 3D software with many tools and built in plugin support, the software is completely free to use.

**Comments:**
- I use Blender on and off for hobby stuff, mostly character modelling and a bit of sculpting.

**Pricing:**
- Free
### [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/au/products/maya/overview)

- 3D software like Blender, marketing themselves with an emphasis for animation.
- Widely considered as a capable tool and the industry standard.

**Comments:**

- I tried using it and really hated it, mostly because I'm already used to the workflow in Blender, and also the hotkeys throw me off so much I hate it....

**Pricing:**

- Subscription based model. with steep pricing
- Has affordable/free licencing with education and the "indie program".

### [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/)

- One of the popular Digital audio workstation (DAW) software capable of many audio related workflows
- Used both by hobbyists and professionals artists/DJs/sound engineers, ect.

**Comments:**
- I’ve used it before for a short period of time, has a pretty nice UI compared to Ableton (also used Ableton before).

**Pricing:** 
- Perpetual licence (a rare thing these days).
- Free lifetime updates (incl. major versions) regardless of edition.

## Section 7: Version Control Tools

((Max 500 words, not including links))

>Write about your team's understanding on what version control is, and whether any members have any experience.
>
Search and list three "version control" providers/tools, and similar to previous sections, compare the tools. In particular, at a minimum, compare data storage limits, costs, and user limits for services.
#### What is Version Control?
Version control is essentially what I think to be a “cloud storage” system, but for your code/software, it allows you to snapshot (save a copy of your work at a specific point/time) your project and makes collaboration between other people much easier and streamlined. I’ve used Git extensively both personally and with others in a group environment.

## Section 8: Production Tools Discussion

((No hard word limit))

- Q: Which of the different "sections" of production (above) do you think are the most important to you currently (individually and/or as a team)? How about in the future?

> A: The most important sections for me currently and in the future (as an individual) would be the asset creation and game engine tools, as I was previously a Computer Science major, now looking to pivot into game development and asset creation, particularly in 3D assets. Both disciplines (game development and asset creations) are areas I would like to delve into both potentially as a hobbyist and potentially a career.

- Q: In relation to the previous question, do you think there's a difference in importance when reaching industry levels or larger team sizes? Why?

> A: Yes, some sections like asset creation and game engine stay relevant regardless of team size, however as team sizes get larger or joining bigger projects, sections like knowledge Base Tools, task management tools and version control tools become critical in facilitating collaboration between many people.

- Q: What about the least important sections, why? Consider comparing different team/company scenarios and project scales.

> A: I don't think there any of the sections are unimportant until reaching X team size, regardless of team size sections like task tracking, version control, and knowledge base are still important, using these sections early on the project sets you up for success when you either inevitable scale in team size or the scope of the project gets larger.
